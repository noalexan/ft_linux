## Introduction

`ft_linux` is a project aimed at constructing a Linux operating system from the ground up. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how Linux systems work by manually building each component from source code. This hands-on approach provides invaluable insight into the inner workings of a Linux OS, making it an excellent educational experience for anyone interested in Linux or operating system development.

## What is Linux From Scratch (LFS)?

Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions on how to build your own custom Linux system entirely from source code. The LFS project is maintained by the Linux From Scratch community and aims to teach the principles and processes involved in creating a working Linux system.

By building an LFS system, you will learn:
- How a Linux system boots
- How various pieces of software interact with each other
- How to troubleshoot and fix issues during the build process
- The structure and organization of a Linux operating system

For more detailed information, visit the [official LFS website](https://linuxfromscratch.org/).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin building your LFS system with `ft_linux`, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

### Hardware Requirements

- **Processor**: A modern x86_64 processor
- **Memory**: At least 4 GB of RAM
- **Disk Space**: At least 10 GB of free disk space
- **Network**: An active internet connection for downloading source packages

### Software Requirements

- **Root Privileges**: Access to root or sudo privileges on the host system
- **Host System**: A running Linux system and after running `./version-check.sh` all test must be OK

### Documentation

- **LFS Book**: A copy of the LFS book corresponding to the version you wish to build. You can download it from the [LFS website](https://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/).
